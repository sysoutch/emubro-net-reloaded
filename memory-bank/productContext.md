# Product Context

## Why this project exists
Retro gaming emulation often involves complex setup processes: finding the right emulator (core), configuring it, managing ROM libraries, and dealing with platform-specific quirks. emuBro exists to abstract this complexity away, offering a "plug-and-play" experience similar to modern game store clients (Steam, Epic, etc.) but for retro games.

## Problems it solves
1.  **Fragmentation:** Emulators are scattered across different websites and interfaces.
2.  **Complexity:** Configuring specific emulators for specific games/systems can be daunting for casual users.
3.  **Library Management:** Organizing large collections of ROMs without a dedicated frontend is difficult.
4.  **Discovery:** Finding tools, bios files, and compatibility info usually requires external research.

## How it should work
-   **Navigation:** Users navigate through clear categories: Home, Emulators, Games, Tags, Tools, Netplay, Wiki.
-   **Interaction:** Clicking "Download" or "Play" should trigger the appropriate action (in a full application, this would interface with the backend/file system).
-   **Visuals:** The interface uses a high-end, "gamer-centric" aesthetic (dark mode default, neon accents, glassmorphism) to feel premium and modern.
-   **Accessibility:** Features like search (Cmd+K) and theme toggling improve usability.

## User Experience Goals
-   **"One Seamless Home":** The user shouldn't feel like they are juggling multiple apps.
-   **Instant Access:** Quick search and intuitive navigation.
-   **Visual Delight:** Animations and smooth transitions make the app feel alive.
-   **Community Integration:** Tabs for Netplay and Wiki suggest a focus on social and knowledge-sharing aspects.
